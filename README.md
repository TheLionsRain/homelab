# 🏠 Homelab

This repository documents and showcases my personal homelab setup, designed as both a self-hosted infrastructure environment and a living DevOps portfolio. It demonstrates my hands-on experience with modern infrastructure tools, system administration, automation, monitoring, and CI/CD practices.

## 🌐 Key Features
- **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)** using tools like Ansible, Bicep and TerraForm
- **Containerized services** via Docker and Kubernetes
- **Monitoring & Observability** using Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki
- **Self-hosted apps**
- **CI/CD Pipelines** with GitHub Actions

## 🎯 Goals

- Showcase real-world DevOps skills and best practices
- Maintain a clean, modular, and reproducible setup
